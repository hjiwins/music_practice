# music_practice ðŸŽ¶

This app is created for young music learners.
Teachers or guardians can set the number of practice sessions, and by using a QR code from the same IP, a checklist will appear on the learner's device. After each practice session, the learner can mark off items by coloring them to show completion.
Thereâ€™s no need for separate sign-ups or settings on every device used. The app can simply be installed on the guardianâ€™s mobile device, and completed practices are saved directly to the device through the app. This makes the process more straightforward, and the learner can easily access the practice page via an internal network by scanning the QR code visible on the guardianâ€™s mobile device.
